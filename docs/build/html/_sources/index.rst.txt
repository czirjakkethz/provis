Welcome to provis's Wiki!
==================================

Provis is a protein visualization library based on python. As the name suggests it is used to visualize proteins from their .pdb data formats (from the 3D coordinates). One can visualize the protein as a stick and point model or as a surface, and many different options can be specified to show the desired properties. 

The library and this documentation were created by Kristof Czirjak as his Bachelor's Thesis at ETH Zurich.

You can find `installation instructions <setup.html>`_ as well as the documentation of the `source code <https://github.com/czirjakkethz/provis>`_.
